	(13, 'WRATH OF MAN', 'picture.jpg', 'The movie is separated into four parts, each circling back to one main event that sets off a chain reaction.\r\n\r\nA Dark Spirit\r\n\r\nAn armored truck is robbed by heavily armed men dressed as construction workers. Two guards and a civilian bystander are killed during the robbery. Five months after the robbery, a mysterious, taciturn man named Patrick Hill (Statham) applies to Fortico Security, the armored truck company that was robbed in the opening scene. In his interview, his soon-to-be superior, Terry (Marsan), commends him for his references and warns him of the fatal robbery. Hill is then introduced to the company trainer Haiden (McCallany), known as &quot;Bullet&quot;, who nicknames him &quot;H&quot; and oversees his training and tests. Hill passes the tests, meeting the bare minimum requirements, and gets off to a rocky start with his new colleagues, including Dave &quot;Boy Sweat&quot; (Hartnett) and Dana Curtis, the only female guard, due to his cold demeanor. On his first official day, Hill, Boy Sweat, and Bullet are assigned to the truck. While driving to the pickup, Boy Sweat tells Hill more about the robbery, revealing that he was supposed to drive the truck but that day had called in sick.\r\n\r\nAfter the pickup, Bullet is taken hostage by gunmen. The robbers radio Dave and Hill and demand the $2 million left in their truck. Boy Sweat panics, trying to remember what protocol is in this situation, ultimately determining they should drive away without Bullet. Hill convinces him to comply and try to save &quot;Bullet.&quot; Hill exits the truck and quickly disposes of the gunmen with expert marksmanship, to the awe of Boy Sweat and Bullet. The police investigators assigned to the robbery question Hill about why his shooting abilities differ from his training scores, which he says is due to the situation heightening his senses. The investigators ask him to watch security footage of the previously mentioned robbery to see if he thinks the two crimes are connected. Hill says there is no connection and is released. Terry tries to give Hill desk duty for a month in case of PTSD, but the CEO of Fortico comes to personally thank Hill, telling Terry he should continue working in the field and get a promotion. The police investigators later identify Hill to their superior, FBI Agent King (Garcia), as someone the Bureau had been looking for 25 years. King tells them to let Hill off the hook and &quot;let the painter paint.&quot; In his hotel room later that night, Hill is visited by an associate who gives him Fortico employee files, photos of coworker Dana Curtis\' family, and an autopsy report. Hill reviews a copy of the robbery footage shown to him by the police investigators. In a later pickup with just Hill and Bullet, the truck is attacked again. The robbers flood the armored truck with tear gas, forcing Hill to exit the truck. As soon as the robbers see Hill\'s face, they quickly retreat. Terry doesn\'t believe his story, thinking him to now be a psychopath, but the Fortico CEO commends Hill once again. Hill, now a hero at work, sleeps with Dana, and then holds her at gunpoint to interrogate her about a $125,000 cash stash he finds. She claims she stole money once from a liquor store for retirement savings. Hill spares her life but threatens further repercussions if he learns she is withholding other information.\r\n\r\nScorched Earth\r\n\r\nThe day of the robbery, Hill is out with his son Dougie when he reluctantly agrees to a work call asking him to help with the recon of an armored truck route. Hill stops at a food truck on the other side of the bridge from the Fortico depot and monitors the gate while Dougie stays in the vehicle. Hill confirms with his coworker that the armored truck turned right out of the gate. As the armored truck goes under the bridge, it is attacked by the men disguised as construction workers. One of the robbers orders Dougie out of his vehicle and is told to lay down on the ground. Hill watches as one of the robbers shoots and murders Dougie. While running towards Dougie, Hill is shot several times, but survives. Before passing out, Hill is able to see the face of one of the gunmen. Three weeks later, Hill wakes up in a hospital and learns of his son\'s death. Hill’s wife claims their son\'s death was his fault and leaves him.'),
